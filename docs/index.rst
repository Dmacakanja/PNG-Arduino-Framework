This version supports some Arduino components:

* Bluetooth
* `LED Matrix - 74HC595/74HC138: <http://www.elabpeers.com/led-matrix-display.html>`_

1. Download the master branch from GitHub.
2. Unzip it
3. Move all folders to your Library folder (On your `Libraries` folder inside Sketchbooks of Arduino software).

================================

.PNG - Programmers of New Generation

## About

PNG Framework was developed by stutents of Unesp - University of the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with the goal to turn Arduino project development easier. The framework has a chain of modular classes, compatible with some Arduino components. 

## Roadmap

This is a completely new library, we have a lot to do. In the next version, we'd love to:
* Bluetooth
..* Test with more modules
* Motor
..* Support N motors.(This version works with two motors)
..* Add new motor drivers support(This version works with L298N Motor Driver Board)
* Servo
..* Rewrite the object without use arduino Servo.h


## Libraries

This version supports some Arduino components:
* Bluetooth
* Motor
* Reflection Sensor
* Servo
* Ultrasonic
* [LED Matrix - 74HC595/74HC138](http://www.elabpeers.com/led-matrix-display.html)

## Installation

1. Download the master branch from GitHub.
2. Unzip it
3. Move all folders to your Library folder (On your `Libraries` folder inside Sketchbooks of Arduino software).


## Contribute

This library still under development. We need help adding new components and testing with differents Arduino and components versions. 
Any help will be appreciated :)

PNG-Arduino-Framework - Beta 0.1
================================

.PNG - Programmers of New Generation

![](https://readthedocs.org/projects/png-arduino-framework/badge/?version=latest)


## About

PNG Framework was developed by stutents of Unesp - University of the State of São Paulo, Brazil, with the goal to turn Arduino project development easier. The framework has a chain of modular classes, compatible with some Arduino components. 


## Roadmap

We have to organize all modules, write some tutorials and publish it. It will take some time...


## Libraries

This version supports some Arduino components:

* Bluetooth
* [LED Matrix - 74HC595/74HC138](http://www.elabpeers.com/led-matrix-display.html)


## Tutorials
* Bluetooth:
  * [How to connect an Android device with Arduino and bluetooth](https://bytedebugger.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/tutorial-how-to-connect-an-android-device-with-arduino-and-bluetooth/)

* LED Matrix:
  * [How to use Dot LED Matrix Display with Arduino](https://bytedebugger.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/tutorial-how-to-use-dot-led-matrix-display-with-arduino/)
  * [Flappy Duino – Creating an Arduino clone of Flappy Bird with LED Matrix](https://bytedebugger.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/flappy-duino-creating-an-arduino-clone-of-flappy-bird-with-led-matrix/)


## Installation

1. Download the master branch from GitHub.
2. Unzip it
3. Move all folders to your Library folder (On your `Libraries` folder inside Sketchbooks of Arduino software).


## Contribute

This library still under development. We need help adding new components and testing with differents Arduino and components versions. 
Any help will be appreciated :)
